Welcome to the AIM Global and Wright University Substainable Supply Chains GitHub.  Because of the extensibility of GS1 EPCIS and other standards, there is the potential to have “too much” flexibility, wherein developers represent this information in divergent methods. To have a concerted approach and standard reference, we have create template events and sample product flows using industry standards and have included many of these examples in this repository.
